## Proposal

### Domain Background

(Dogs vs. Cats) The project is a competition topic for kaggle in 2013. The goal is to train a model to distinguish whether it is a cat or a dog from a given picture. This is a problem in the field of computer vision, and also a binary classifaction problem.

Deep learning is one of the most important breakthroughs in the field of artificial intelligence in the past decade. It has achieved great success in speech recognition, natural language processing, computer vision, image and video analysis, multimedia, and many other fields.

The most influential breakthrough in deep learning in computer vision occurred in 2012, and Hinton's research team won the ImageNet Image Classification Competition with deep learning. Since then, the annual ImageNet image classification competition has won the championship of the neural network.


| Year | Model | Top 5 error rate |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 2012 | AlexNet | 15.4%	 |
| 2013 | ZFNet | 11.2%	 |
| 2014 | GoogLeNet | 6.7%	 |
| 2015 | ResNet | 3.57%	 |
| 2016 | GBD-Net | 2.99%	 |
| 2017 | SeNet | 2.3%	 |


### Problem Statement

Input: A color photo.
Output: The probability(0~1) of a cat or a dog.
The project needs to identify cats and dogs, which is essentially a binary classification problem. Corresponding to supervised learning is to use the existing pictures with labels, and after the training is completed, the unlabeled pictures are classified. Therefore, it is also possible to solve this problem using a supervised learning method such as SVM. But due to the excellent performance of deep learning, I will choose the deep learning method to complete this project.

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
